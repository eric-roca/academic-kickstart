abstract = "**Awarded the 'UWIN Best Paper Award on Gender Economics', 7th edition.**  <br> **Awarded a 'Valeria Solesin' accessit, 2018 edition.** <br>**Revise & Resubmit at _Journal of Economic Growth_**<br> This paper is concerned with the historical roots of gender equality. It proposes and empirically assesses a new class of determinants of gender equality: increases in women's bargaining power through reductions in the cost of remaining single. In particular, enlarging women's options besides marriage &mdash;even if only temporarily&mdash; increases their bargaining power with respect to men, leading to a persistent improvement in gender equality. We illustrate this mechanism focusing on the specific Belgian context, and relate gender-equality levels in the 19th century to the presence of medieval, female-only communities called _beguinages_ that allowed women to remain single amidst a society that advocated the opposite. Combining precise beguinages' location with 19th-century census data, we document that beguinages were instrumental in decreasing the gender gap in literacy."
