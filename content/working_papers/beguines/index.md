abstract="**Awarded the 'UWIN Best Paper Award on Gender Economics', 7th edition.**  <br> This paper is concerned with the historical determinants of gender equality. In the specific context of Belgium, it relates higher levels of gender equality during the 19th century to the presence of medieval, female-only, Belgian communities called beguinages. Our results are in line with the extensive empirical evidence documenting the persistence of gender norms and culture. Finally, we propose a novel class of mechanisms, based on improvements in girls’ bargaining power, to rationalise our findings."

summary = "**Awarded the 'UWIN Best Paper Award on Gender Economics', 7th edition.** <br> This paper is concerned with the historical determinants of gender equality. In the specific context of Belgium, it relates higher levels of gender equality during the 19th century to the presence of medieval, female-only, Belgian communities called beguinages. Combining a novel, hand-collected data-set on beguinage location with 19th-century Belgian census data, we document that in municipalities where beguine communities settled the literacy gap reduced. Schooling was not compulsory and literacy differentials reflect parental tenets on gender equality. Using changes in the political organisation through which some villages became more attractive to beguines, we establish that the variation in gender literacy is indeed related to the presence of beguinages. Our results are in line with the extensive empirical evidence documenting the persistence of gender norms and culture. Finally, we propose a novel class of mechanisms, based on improvements in girls’ bargaining power, to rationalise our findings."
