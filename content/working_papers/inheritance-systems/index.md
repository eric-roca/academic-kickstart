abstract = "**Resubmitted to _Macroeconomic Dynamics_**. <br> We analyse an overlooked determinant of state capacity at its early stages. Based on a theoretical model, this paper advances that the degree of gender-egalitarianism embedded in inheritance rules affects state capacity. The model combines two forces that drive state capacity building as it permits to raise taxes and overcome rivals. It accommodates dynasties in its simplest form and introduces inter-state marriages of landed heirs. On the one hand, the idea of dynastic continuity, of utmost importance to European medieval rulers, directly encourages state building. On the other hand, a wealth effect that gains significance through marriages indirectly promotes it. Gender-biased inheritance rules favouring men incentivise state-building because, historically, men continued dynasties and it was valued. We weigh this effect against the indirect effect of more land-merging marriages under gender-egalitarian rules. Our results suggest that gender-egalitarian rules promote state capacity in the short run. This new result nuances the idea that higher probability of continued rule boosts state capacity. We also corroborate the importance of continued rule: in the long run, genderbiased rules gender-neutral norms. This provides a rationale for the pervasive European tradition of preferring men over women as heirs."
