# Abstract and optional shortened version.
abstract = "This paper advances the importance of degree of gender-egalitarianism embedded in inheritance rules in determining state capacity at its early stages during medieval time.  We present a theoretical model whereby state capacity building permits to raise taxes and overcome rivals. It accommodates dynasties in its simplest form and introduces inter-state marriages of landed heirs. On the one hand, dynastic continuity —of utmost importance to European medieval rulers— directly encourages state building. Gender-biased inheritance rules favouring men historically maximise the likelihood of dynastic continuity. We weigh this effect against the indirect impact of more land-merging marriages under gender-egalitarian rules. Contrary to the literature, our results suggest that gender-egalitarian norms —offering low probability of dynastic continuation— promote state capacity in the short run more than gender-biased norms. In the long run results are reversed, providing a rationale for the pervasive European tradition of preferring men over women as heirs."

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
summary = "We analyse how inheritance rules affect rulers' willingness to invest in state capacity. We find that rules that privelege men over women generate higher levels of state capacity in the long run."
