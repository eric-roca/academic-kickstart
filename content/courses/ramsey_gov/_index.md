## Introduction

We now augment the Ramsey model, incorporating a government.

It taxes households with a lump-sum tax $T\_{t}$ and uses these proceedings to buy goods $G\_{t}.$
**Assumption RG 1**
We assume that government purchases _do not_ affect the utility derived from private consumption.
This can be because:

* The government devotes revenue $T\_{t}$ to an activity households do not derive utility from
* Households utility equals the sum of private consumption and goods provided by the government.

**Assumption RG 2**
Another assumption is that the government uses _all_ taxes to fund exclusively its purchases $G\_{t}.$
Therefore, the government _does not_ save: no public investment.

Finally, the government runs a balanced budget in each and every period: $G\_{t} = T\_{t}.$i[^1]

[^1]: Romer, in _Advanced Macroeconomics_ chapter 11 shows that in the Ramsey model the choice between taxes and deficit does not impact the relevant variables.

This extension _does not_ modify the behaviour of firms.
In fact, taxes affect only households through their budget constraint.
