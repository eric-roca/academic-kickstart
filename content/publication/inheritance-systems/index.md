abstract = "**In _Macroeconomic Dynamics_**. <br> This paper examines how the degree of gender-egalitarianism embedded in inheritance rules impacts state capacity at its early stages during medieval times. We present a theoretical model in which building state capacity enables nobles to raise taxes and overcome rivals.  The model addresses the use of inheritance to consolidate landholding dynasties, also accommodating inter-state marriages between landed heirs. On the one hand, dynastic continuity &mdash;of utmost importance to European medieval lords&mdash; directly encourages statebuilding. Male-biased inheritance rules historically maximise the likelihood of dynastic continuity. We weigh this effect against the indirect impact of the more frequent land merging marriages under gender-egalitarian rules. Contrary to the literature, our results suggest that gender-egalitarian norms —offering a low probability of dynastic continuity— promote state capacity in the short run more than gender-biased norms. In the long run results are reversed, providing a rationale for the pervasive European tradition of preference for men as heirs." 

summary = "**In _Macroeconomic Dynamics_**. <br> This paper examines how the degree of gender-egalitarianism embedded in inheritance rules impacts state building. Male-biased inheritance rules historically maximise the likelihood of dynastic continuity. However, there is more land merging under gender-egalitarian rules. We compare both types of inheritance rules, concluding that, contrary to the literature, gender-egalitarian norms promote state capacity in the short run more than gender-biased norms. In the long run results are reversed."
